### Secure Wallet for Crypto Storage

One of the key features of Cryptex is its secure wallet, designed to keep your 
cryptocurrencies safe and protected. The wallet utilizes advanced encryption 
techniques to safeguard your funds and ensure that only you have control over 
your assets. You can store popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), 
Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and many others.

Cryptex simplifies crypto operations, making it easy for both beginners and 
experienced users to manage their digital assets. Whether you want to send 
cryptocurrencies to friends or family, receive payments, buy new tokens, sell your 
existing holdings, or convert between different cryptocurrencies, Cryptex provides a 
seamless and intuitive interface to perform these actions effortlessly.

### Coming Features
