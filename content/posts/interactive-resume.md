# Profile

With over 3 years of experience in software engineering, I bring a strong background in creating and maintaining projects in Golang. Working within a Unix/Linux environment comes naturally to me, and my skills extend to SQL database management, query optimization, and using git for version control, technical discussion, and code maintenance. I have a background in security and a track record of mentoring junior engineers in Go and backend engineering. I am eager to contribute my expertise and passion to the team at Team Cymru and help enhance Internet security.

### **My mission is simple:**

**Build modern scalable and maintainable software as a DevOps engineer.**

# Skills

### Technical Writing

---

I have been writing commercially for about 6 years. I got into the tech space in 2019/2020, where I started writing technical articles. I moved into technical writing fully in 2020 and have honed my writing and programming skills to remarkable heights. I have written for:

- [LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/macbobbychibuzor/)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/macbobby/)
- [Hashnode](https://ghostmac.hashnode.dev)
- [Quicknode](https://blog.quicknode.com/understanding-erc-4337-and-erc-4804-standards/)
- Others

### Backend Engineering

---

I have been building application backend logic since 2020, initially with the Python programming languageâ€™s Flask framework. I however migrated fully to Golang the following year as it is a promising programming language.  My strengths include:

- Microservices Architecture with Golang
- Software Testing and Deployment
- RESTFul API Development
- Database Engineering (SQL, SQLite)
- Cloud Engineering
- Golang & Frameworks
- Rust

### Blockchain Engineering

---

I am proficient about blockchain development and engineering for Web3. I am capable of building smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, Chaincodes on the Cardano blockchain, and currently learning Rust for Blockchain cryptography and protocols engineering. I went through #100DaysOfCode #Blockchain where I learned how to engineer a blockchain from scratch using Go and relying on the technologies separately.

- Solidity for Ethereum
- Rust for Cryptography and Protocols
- Golang for Protocols, Cosmos and Hyperledger Fabric

### DevOps Engineering

---

I am somewhat proficient in cloud DevOps tasks with practical experience using:

- Bash for Shell Scripting
- Ansible for Automation
- Linux OS
- AWS Cloud DevOps
- Docker
- Kubernetes
